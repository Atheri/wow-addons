# wow-addons
Some little World of Warcraft addons I've been tinkering with. Mostly learning how to make them, and learning the WoW API.

TelchMain - Using a table of names / class combinations, print something to guild chat based on the name. Triggered by event CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM, which fires on things like online / offline,  and loot and difficulty changes.

KirossShh - Triggered by about 10 events, all dealing with a player publicly (no whispers) communicating. Repsonds to specific players in the form / channel that they communicated in to fire the event.
